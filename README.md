To build and run this server, you'll need the following software installed:

* **Microsoft Visual Studio**: Required for compiling the C++/C# source code.
* **PostgreSQL**: The primary database used to store all game data.
* **.NET Framework**: For certain server components.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dekthaiinchina/PointBlankServer.git
    ```

2.  **Set up the database**:
    * Create a new database instance in PostgreSQL.
    * Execute the SQL scripts found in the project folder to create all the necessary tables and stored procedures.

3.  **Configure the server**:
    * Edit the `./build/rel/Config` or `./build/dbg/Config` file to set your database connection string and server settings.

4.  **Build and run**:
    * Open the `PointBlankServer.sln` file in Visual Studio.
    * Select your desired build configuration (`Debug` or `Release`) and build the solution.
